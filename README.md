# nn_optimization
A neural network framwork for demonstrating hyperparameter optimization

This repository accompanies the [End to End Machine Learning](http://e2eml.school)
 Course 313, Neural Network Optimization.

Forked from the [nn-framework](https://github.com/brohrer/nn_framework/releases/tag/v-0-2)
repository. This repo extends it and modifies it in non-backward compatible ways.
